Our framework for teaching (inspired from models below) - we can use each one in different scenarios and different lessons, depending on what the goal of the lesson is. 

# Frameworks for teaching

Although at the end of each lesson it is not required that students learn a full skill (we should map out the skills we want to teach), they should be able to “do” something that gets them closer to that skill. 

## Outcomes and skills we are hoping to cover

**Big Goals — For Students to:**

- [ ]  Have a working sense of the history of money (”How We Got Here”)
- [ ]  Understand the fundamentals of Bitcoin
- [ ]  Be able to use, transact, and secure Bitcoin (including through the Lightning Network)
- [ ]  Understand and be able to get involved with mining
- [ ]  Be able to teach others about Bitcoin

**Weekly Outcomes:**

*what outcomes for student success do we need to see every week?*

**Proficiencies & skills:**
